# TidyGen ERP ‚Äì Web3 Foundation Grant Proposal (Level 2)

## 1. Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The $400B+ cleaning services industry ‚Äî and broader service economy ‚Äî struggles with:

* **Service verification disputes** ‚Üí billions lost annually.
* **Slow, expensive payments** ‚Üí 30-day delays, 15% fees.
* **Operational inefficiencies** ‚Üí 60% manual workflows.
* **Low digital adoption** ‚Üí only 12% use ERP systems today.

### Why TidyGen ERP?

**TidyGen ERP** is the **first Web3-enabled ERP** for service industries, designed to combine **enterprise workflows** with **decentralized trust**.

* **ERP Core** ‚Üí Multi-tenant, API-first, compliance-ready.
* **Web3 Features** ‚Üí

  * Job verification via smart contracts.
  * Escrow-based automated payments.
  * IPFS proof-of-work storage.
  * DID (future) for worker identity & reputation.

### Alignment with the Polkadot Ecosystem

While our MVP is blockchain-agnostic, our long-term vision aligns with **Polkadot‚Äôs interoperability and multi-chain architecture**:

* **Cross-chain ERP adoption** ‚Üí Enterprises operate across borders; Polkadot enables seamless multi-chain payment and verification flows.
* **Substrate-based modules** ‚Üí Future milestones will port **verification + escrow contracts** into Substrate pallets for tighter Polkadot integration.
* **DID + Identity** ‚Üí Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem (e.g., KILT Protocol) is an ideal foundation for decentralized worker identity and credential management.
* **Scalability & Governance** ‚Üí Polkadot‚Äôs parachain model fits TidyGen‚Äôs **multi-tenant, enterprise-scale needs** better than siloed Ethereum solutions.

### Current Status

* ‚úÖ **Live MVP deployed**:

  * üåê [Frontend Portal](https://community.tidygen.com)
  * ‚öôÔ∏è [Backend Swagger UI](https://api.tidygen.com)
* ‚úÖ **Reproducible local setup** with Docker + docs.
* üöÄ **Next step with W3F grant** ‚Üí implement job verification, escrow, and IPFS integration.
