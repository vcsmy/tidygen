# Smart Contracts

This folder will hold Solidity/Rust smart contracts, ABI files, and deployment scripts for Web3 integration.

## Structure

- `artifacts/` - Compiled contract artifacts and ABI files
- `src/` - Smart contract source code (Solidity/Rust)
- `scripts/` - Deployment and interaction scripts
- `tests/` - Contract test files
- `deployments/` - Deployment configurations and addresses

## Web3 Integration

The smart contracts will enable:

- **Service Verification**: Cryptographic proof of service completion
- **Automated Payments**: Trustless payment processing
- **Asset Tokenization**: Physical assets as tradeable tokens
- **Dispute Resolution**: Decentralized dispute handling
- **Performance Tracking**: On-chain metrics and analytics

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Smart contracts are currently being developed and will be available in upcoming releases.

## Quick Start

Once contracts are deployed, see [demo.md](./demo.md) for instructions on running a sample job verification â†’ payment flow.
