## 1. Smart Contract-Based Financial Records

### Overview
Implement blockchain-based financial record keeping to create immutable, transparent, and verifiable financial transactions while maintaining the flexibility of traditional accounting systems.

### Technical Implementation

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract FinancialRecord {
    struct Transaction {
        uint256 id;
        address from;
        address to;
        uint256 amount;
        string description;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 hash;
        bool verified;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Transaction) public transactions;
    uint256 public transactionCount;
    
    function recordTransaction(
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        string memory description,
        bytes32 hash
    ) external returns (uint256);
    
    function verifyTransaction(uint256 id) external;
    function getTransactionHistory(address account) external view returns (Transaction[] memory);
}
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Reward Token Contract
```solidity
contract RewardToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
    struct Reward {
        uint256 amount;
        string reason;
        uint256 timestamp;
        address issuer;
        bool claimed;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Reward[]) public userRewards;
    mapping(string => uint256) public rewardCategories;
    
    function issueReward(
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        string memory reason,
        string memory category
    ) external onlyOwner;
    
    function claimReward(uint256 rewardId) external;
    function getRewardHistory(address user) external view returns (Reward[] memory);
