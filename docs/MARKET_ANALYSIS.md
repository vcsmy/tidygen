# TidyGen ERP - Market Analysis (TAM, SAM, SOM)

## 1. Introduction

### **Market Sizing Definitions**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)** represents the total revenue opportunity available if a product or service achieved 100% market share in its relevant market. It's the "pie in the sky" number that shows the maximum potential if every potential customer adopted the solution.

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM)** is the portion of TAM that can be realistically served by a company's products or services, considering factors like geographic focus, industry verticals, and regulatory constraints. It represents the market that is both accessible and relevant to the business model.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** is the realistic market share a company can capture within the SAM over a specific timeframe (typically 3-5 years), considering competitive landscape, resource constraints, and adoption rates. It's the most conservative and actionable market estimate.

### **Why Market Sizing Matters for Web3 Grant Applications**

Market sizing is crucial for Web3 grant applications and investor presentations because it:

- **Demonstrates Market Opportunity**: Shows the scale of the problem being solved and the potential impact of the solution
- **Validates Business Viability**: Proves that the market is large enough to support sustainable business growth
- **Guides Resource Allocation**: Helps prioritize development efforts and go-to-market strategies
- **Attracts Investment**: Provides concrete numbers that investors and grant committees can evaluate
- **Shows Ecosystem Impact**: Demonstrates how the project contributes to Web3 adoption and ecosystem growth

For TidyGen ERP, market sizing validates our position as the first comprehensive Web3-enabled ERP system in the cleaning services industry, showing both the massive opportunity and our realistic path to market capture.
