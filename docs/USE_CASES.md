### **How TidyGen Solves It**

#### **Smart Contract Service Verification**
```solidity
// Service completion automatically verified on blockchain
contract OfficeCleaningService {
    struct ServiceRecord {
        uint256 serviceId;
        address client;
        address serviceProvider;
        string buildingAddress;
        bytes32 completionHash;
        bool verified;
        uint256 completedAt;
    }
    
    function completeService(
        uint256 serviceId, 
        bytes32 completionHash,
        string memory buildingAddress
    ) external {
        ServiceRecord storage service = services[serviceId];
        require(service.serviceProvider == msg.sender, "Unauthorized");
        
        service.completed = true;
        service.completionHash = completionHash;
        service.completedAt = block.timestamp;
        
        // Automatically trigger payment release after 24 hours
        schedulePaymentRelease(serviceId, 24 hours);
    }
}
```

#### **Automated Route Optimization**
```typescript
// AI-powered route optimization
class RouteOptimizer {
  async optimizeDailyRoutes(buildings: Building[]): Promise<OptimizedRoute[]> {
    const routes = await this.aiService.optimizeRoutes({
      locations: buildings.map(b => b.address),
      constraints: {
        maxTravelTime: 30, // minutes
        serviceDuration: buildings.map(b => b.estimatedDuration),
        teamCapacity: 4 // cleaners per team
      }
    });
    
    return routes.map(route => ({
      id: generateRouteId(),
      buildings: route.locations,
      estimatedDuration: route.totalTime,
      fuelCost: route.fuelEstimate,
      efficiency: route.efficiencyScore
    }));
  }
}
```

#### **Trustless Payment Processing**
```solidity
// Automated escrow payments
contract PaymentEscrow {
    function createServiceEscrow(
        uint256 serviceId,
        address client,
        address serviceProvider,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        escrows[serviceId] = EscrowRecord({
            client: client,
            serviceProvider: serviceProvider,
            amount: amount,
            deadline: block.timestamp + 7 days,
            completed: false
        });
        
        // Transfer payment to escrow
        IERC20(USDC).transferFrom(client, address(this), amount);
    }
    
    function releasePayment(uint256 serviceId) external {
        EscrowRecord storage escrow = escrows[serviceId];
        require(escrow.completed, "Service not completed");
        
        // Automatically release payment to service provider
        IERC20(USDC).transfer(escrow.serviceProvider, escrow.amount);
    }
}
```

### **How TidyGen Solves It**

#### **Decentralized Identity Verification**
```typescript
// DID-based identity verification for cleaners
class CleanerVerification {
  async verifyCleanerIdentity(cleanerAddress: string): Promise<VerificationResult> {
    // Check DID credentials
    const didDocument = await this.didService.getDIDDocument(cleanerAddress);
    
    // Verify background check credentials
    const backgroundCheck = await this.verifyCredential(
      didDocument.credentials.backgroundCheck
    );
    
    // Verify insurance credentials
    const insurance = await this.verifyCredential(
      didDocument.credentials.insurance
    );
    
    // Verify training certificates
    const training = await this.verifyCredential(
      didDocument.credentials.training
    );
    
    return {
      verified: backgroundCheck.valid && insurance.valid && training.valid,
      credentials: {
        backgroundCheck: backgroundCheck.status,
        insurance: insurance.status,
        training: training.status
      },
      trustScore: this.calculateTrustScore(backgroundCheck, insurance, training)
    };
  }
}
```

#### **NFT-Based Service Verification**
```solidity
// NFT certificates for completed services
contract ServiceCertificate {
    struct ServiceNFT {
        uint256 tokenId;
        address homeowner;
        address cleaner;
        string serviceType;
        uint256 completedAt;
        string qualityRating;
        bytes32 photoHash;
        bool verified;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => ServiceNFT) public serviceNFTs;
    
    function mintServiceCertificate(
        address homeowner,
        address cleaner,
        string memory serviceType,
        string memory qualityRating,
        string memory photoHash
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        
        serviceNFTs[tokenId] = ServiceNFT({
            tokenId: tokenId,
            homeowner: homeowner,
            cleaner: cleaner,
            serviceType: serviceType,
            completedAt: block.timestamp,
            qualityRating: qualityRating,
            photoHash: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(photoHash)),
            verified: true
        });
        
        _safeMint(homeowner, tokenId);
        return tokenId;
    }
}
```

#### **Reputation and Rating System**
```solidity
// On-chain reputation system
contract CleanerReputation {
    struct CleanerProfile {
        address cleaner;
        uint256 totalServices;
        uint256 averageRating;
        uint256 totalEarnings;
        mapping(string => uint256) serviceTypeCount;
        mapping(string => uint256) serviceTypeRating;
    }
    
    mapping(address => CleanerProfile) public cleanerProfiles;
    
    function updateReputation(
        address cleaner,
        string memory serviceType,
        uint256 rating,
        uint256 earnings
    ) external {
        CleanerProfile storage profile = cleanerProfiles[cleaner];
        
        // Update total services
        profile.totalServices++;
        
        // Update average rating
        uint256 currentTotal = profile.averageRating * (profile.totalServices - 1);
        profile.averageRating = (currentTotal + rating) / profile.totalServices;
        
        // Update earnings
        profile.totalEarnings += earnings;
        
        // Update service type specific data
        profile.serviceTypeCount[serviceType]++;
        uint256 currentTypeTotal = profile.serviceTypeRating[serviceType] * 
            (profile.serviceTypeCount[serviceType] - 1);
        profile.serviceTypeRating[serviceType] = 
            (currentTypeTotal + rating) / profile.serviceTypeCount[serviceType];
