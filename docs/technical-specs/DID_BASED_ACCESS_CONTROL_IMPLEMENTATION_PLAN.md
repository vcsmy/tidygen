# DID-Based Access Control Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Decentralized Identity (DID) into the TidyGen ERP system, replacing traditional authentication with DID-based access control using DIDKit/Veramo and W3C DID standards.

## Goals

- Replace traditional email/password authentication with DID-based authentication
- Implement decentralized identity management using W3C DID standards
- Map DID roles to ERP permissions (finance manager, auditor, etc.)
- Store DID metadata in PostgreSQL with on-chain registry sync
- Create UI for managing DID-based roles and access levels
- Ensure compatibility with W3C DID standards

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DID Models**: Database models for storing DID documents and metadata
2. **DIDKit Integration**: Python wrapper for DIDKit operations
3. **Authentication System**: DID-based authentication middleware
4. **Permission Mapping**: Role-based access control using DID attributes
5. **On-Chain Registry**: Smart contract for DID document storage
6. **Management UI**: Interface for DID role management
7. **Sync Service**: Bidirectional sync between database and blockchain

## Database Schema

### DIDDocument Model
```python
class DIDDocument(models.Model):
    did = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    document = models.JSONField()
    controller = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    on_chain_tx_hash = models.CharField(max_length=66, blank=True)
    on_chain_block_number = models.BigIntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
```

### DIDRole Model
```python
class DIDRole(models.Model):
    did = models.ForeignKey(DIDDocument, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    permissions = models.JSONField()
    granted_by = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # DID of granter
    granted_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    expires_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### DIDCredential Model
```python
class DIDCredential(models.Model):
    did = models.ForeignKey(DIDDocument, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    credential_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    credential_data = models.JSONField()
    issuer = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    issued_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    expires_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    revoked = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

    struct DIDDocument {
        string did;
        string document;
        address controller;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(string => DIDDocument) public didDocuments;
    mapping(address => string[]) public controllerDIDs;
    
    event DIDCreated(string indexed did, address indexed controller);
    event DIDUpdated(string indexed did, address indexed controller);
    event DIDRevoked(string indexed did, address indexed controller);
    
    function createDID(string memory did, string memory document) external;
    function updateDID(string memory did, string memory document) external;
