Thatâ€™s exactly the right approach, Vijay âœ…

If you test everything before applying, youâ€™ll tick off the **3 biggest things Web3 Foundation reviewers care about**:

1. **Reproducibility** â€“ they can clone your repo, run `docker-compose up`, and see it working.
2. **Transparency** â€“ live frontend + backend links show youâ€™re serious and already have traction.
3. **Clarity** â€“ a lean grant proposal with clear milestones + budget makes it easy to approve.

âš¡ With the plan we structured:

* Your **Level 2 proposal** (~$42k ask) shows you already have MVP and need funding only for **core Web3 functionality** (verification, escrow, IPFS).
* Your **investor deck** positions you for **future funding ($2Mâ€“$3M)** once you deliver grant milestones.

Thatâ€™s a **powerful one-two punch** â€” reviewers see credibility, investors see vision.

ðŸ”‘ **Final Checklist before applying**

* [ ] Test local setup instructions (fresh clone, run locally).
* [ ] Verify CI/CD badges (green).
* [ ] Confirm live demo URLs load correctly.
* [ ] Review `GRANT_PROPOSAL.md` â†’ make sure milestones + budget are lean (Level 2 ready).
* [ ] Add community contact (Discord, GitHub discussions).

Once all âœ… â†’ **submit immediately**. Early submissions often get faster review.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also **simulate a W3F reviewerâ€™s perspective** (pros/cons, likely questions theyâ€™ll ask, and how you should answer)? That way youâ€™ll be ready before you hit submit.
