## 🌐 Why Web3?

TidyGen ERP isn’t just another accounting system — it’s built for the decentralized future.

- **Immutable Audit Trails** – Every transaction can be logged on-chain for tamper-proof compliance
- **Smart Contract Automation** – Financial workflows like invoicing, payroll, and tax filing can be governed by programmable logic
- **Multi-Chain Support** – Designed to integrate with Ethereum, Polkadot, and other chains for cross-border finance

By embedding Web3 into core accounting, TidyGen empowers businesses with transparency, trust, and sovereignty.
